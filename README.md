# NettySight - A Web-Based Network Reporter Tool

## <em>Background</em>
In recent years, network infrastructure has rapidly changed, Many firms and businesses have repositioned themselves to recent, bare, manageable, and modern networking infrastructure. By changing their old physical systems to a new one.
Processes of migration systems have broken down a lot of pressure on a site engineer because a working system (old one) has operated fine for one year, five years or a decade. Site engineers must be careful in every step their take.
Log of old device is important for migration network system, site engineer use log to compare and convert existing network to new device (from a centralized configuration)

## <em>Functions</em>
- Users can register network devices and group multiple devices on a single webpage.
- Automatically collect log from all registered devices.
- Beautified and display formatted configuration of registered devices.
- Engineers can export .xlsx files (ex. Associate interface in L2 devices for using in mapping VLAN for migration process) via web application.
- Use NETCONF or Ansible for the ability to work with existing network devices.

## <em>Our Goal</em>
- To decrease user error in the migration process, some configuration of the old system may be missing from open configuration data in .txt files
- To improve time consume for troubleshooting process by having configuration backup and formattrated for ready to read pattern.
- To create a mobile device accessible. A text file of configuration is obviously hard to read on mobile devices.
- To establish ability for managing reports and configuration data, users can group their device by a parameter such as Region and Province. Likewise, if it has 10 or more devices in the network, users can access the running configuration data of every device through a webpage.
- To serve a ready to use report for engineers, decrease time for preparation in migration processes.
